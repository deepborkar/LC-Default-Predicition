Follow this order to navigate around the project:

- The project is split into 5 files. 
   1. Data Preprocessing - Data Cleaning, Transformation etc.
   2. Gradient Boosting Model
   3. Neural Network Model
   4. Logistic Regression Model
   5. Business Analysis - estimating interest rate, NPV, PMT
   
 This project is an on-going attempt to learn and research new machine learning techniques through implementation.
 I will keep updating this project to make is more user-friendly, advanced and business oriented.
